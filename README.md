angular-highcharts-module
=========================

Provides reusable directives, services and filters for rendering interactive highcharts using angular.

The whole point of a client side chart is the interactivity it can provide.

Highcharts library is very capable of dynamically updating the charts based on the updated series. But has been up to the developer to provide the interactive options, to change these dynamically. Only up until now!

By using JSONS in a specified format, the directives here can provide interactive options for various things.

Specifically:

- Changing the attribute to view, on the fly.
- Changing the JSON, on the fly.
- Rendering charts that have multiple y axis and multiple series.

Examples for each of these charts are documented in the sample folder. Examples use Sachin Tendulkar's cricketing scores.
